# Internet-of-Things
Things like environments, vehicles, equipment may have the ability to sense, collect data and produce new information which can be transmitted over the Internet

The Internet of things (IoT) allows objects to be sensed or controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure [6] creating opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems, and resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy and economic benefit in addition to reduced human intervention.
